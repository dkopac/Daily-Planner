# Daily-Planner

Module 5 Third Party API's Challenge
This weeks Challenge prompted us to make an hourly planner for the day. Started out with a starter code that we needed to modify. With the help of my tutor "Mila Hose" I was able to get the base portion of my JavaScript portion done to get the past present and future hours to work and be color coordinated along with getting the words to save to the browser and the actual webpage itself.
