# Daily-Planner

Module 5 Third Party API's Challenge
This weeks Challenge prompted us to make an hourly planner for the day. Started out with a starter code that we needed to modify. With the help of my tutor "Mila Hose" I was able to get the base portion of my JavaScript portion done to get the past present and future hours to work and be color coordinated along with getting the words to save to the browser and the actual webpage itself.
When the starter code is originally generated we are only given 3 hours on the page. Using the HTML file I was able to add the last 5 hours to the webpage. After that the "script.js" file was blank so we were instructed to do that from scratch. With the help of my tutor and the lessons prior i was able to complete this task and make it what it is now.
